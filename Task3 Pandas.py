"""## DataFrame basics

### A few of the fundamental routines for selecting, sorting, adding and aggregating data in DataFrames

Difficulty: *easy*

Note: remember to import numpy using:
```python
import numpy as np
```

Consider the following Python dictionary `data` and Python list `labels`:

``` python
data = {'animal': ['cat', 'cat', 'snake', 'dog', 'dog', 'cat', 'snake', 'cat', 'dog', 'dog'],
        'age': [2.5, 3, 0.5, np.nan, 5, 2, 4.5, np.nan, 7, 3],
        'visits': [1, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 1],
        'priority': ['yes', 'yes', 'no', 'yes', 'no', 'no', 'no', 'yes', 'no', 'no']}

labels = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j']

Previous exercises have seen us analysing data from DataFrames equipped with a single index level. However, pandas also gives you the possibilty of indexing your data using *multiple* levels. This is very much like adding new dimensions to a Series or a DataFrame.

The set of puzzles below explores how you might use multiple index levels to enhance data analysis.

To warm up, we'll look make a Series with two index levels.

## Minesweeper

### Generate the numbers for safe squares in a Minesweeper grid

Difficulty: *medium* to *hard*

If you've ever used an older version of Windows, there's a good chance you've played with [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game). If you're not familiar with the game, imagine a grid of squares: some of these squares conceal a mine. If you click on a mine, you lose instantly. If you click on a safe square, you reveal a number telling you how many mines are found in the squares that are immediately adjacent. The aim of the game is to uncover all squares in the grid that do not contain a mine.

In this section, we'll make a DataFrame that contains the necessary data for a game of Minesweeper: coordinates of the squares, whether the square contains a mine and the number of mines found on adjacent squares.

**51**. Let's suppose we're playing Minesweeper on a 5 by 4 grid, i.e.
```
X = 5
Y = 4
```
To begin, generate a DataFrame `df` with two columns, `'x'` and `'y'` containing every coordinate for this grid. That is, the DataFrame should start:
```
   x  y
0  0  0
1  0  1
2  0  2
```

"""## Plotting

### Visualize trends and patterns in data

Difficulty: *medium*

To really get a good understanding of the data contained in your DataFrame, it is often essential to create plots: if you're lucky, trends and anomalies will jump right out at you. This functionality is baked into pandas and the puzzles below explore some of what's possible with the library.

**56.** Pandas is highly integrated with the plotting library matplotlib, and makes plotting DataFrames very user-friendly! Plotting in a notebook environment usually makes use of the following boilerplate:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
plt.style.use('ggplot')
```

matplotlib is the plotting library which pandas' plotting functionality is built upon, and it is usually aliased to ```plt```.

```%matplotlib inline``` tells the notebook to show plots inline, instead of creating them in a separate window.  

```plt.style.use('ggplot')``` is a style theme that most people find agreeable, based upon the styling of R's ggplot package.

For starters, make a scatter plot of this random data, but use black X's instead of the default markers. 

```df = pd.DataFrame({"xs":[1,5,2,8,1], "ys":[4,2,1,9,6]})```

Consult the [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html) if you get stuck!

"""Now we're finally ready to create a candlestick chart, which is a very common tool used to analyze stock price data.  A candlestick chart shows the opening, closing, highest, and lowest price for a stock during a time window.  The color of the "candle" (the thick part of the bar) is green if the stock closed above its opening price, or red if below.

![Candlestick Example](img/candle.jpg)

This was initially designed to be a pandas plotting challenge, but it just so happens that this type of plot is just not feasible using pandas' methods.  If you are unfamiliar with matplotlib, we have provided a function that will plot the chart for you so long as you can use pandas to get the data into the correct format.

Your first step should be to get the data in the correct format using pandas' time-series grouping function.  We would like each candle to represent an hour's worth of data.  You can write your own aggregation function which returns the open/high/low/close, but pandas has a built-in which also does this.

The below cell contains helper functions.  Call ```day_stock_data()``` to generate a DataFrame containing the prices a hypothetical stock sold for, and the time the sale occurred.  Call ```plot_candlestick(df)``` on your properly aggregated and formatted stock data to print the candlestick chart.
